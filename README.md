# ☕ HTML - Chai aur Code Playground 💻

A hands-on beginners’ playground for learning **HTML** – sip some chai, write some markup, and build web pages while you learn.

## ✨ About The Project

This repository serves as a personal collection of code, notes, and practical exercises based on the comprehensive **HTML course** by **Chai aur Code** on YouTube. It is designed to be a clear, organized resource for anyone following along or looking for practical examples of core HTML concepts.

The goal is to provide simple, well-commented code snippets that correspond to the topics covered in the video tutorials, making it easier to review and test the concepts learned.
